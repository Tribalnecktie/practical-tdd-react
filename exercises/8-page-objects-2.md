# Page Objects 2

To solidfy our knowledge of Page Objects and to get more practice using the different Cypress commands, let's use Cypress to drive the development of the functionality that actually adds a taco to the cart. The steps for this exercise are intentionally very high level to allow you to work through the problem on your own.

## Steps

1. When the user clicks the plus button for a taco, then the cart count should be updated to reflect the number of tacos that the user has in their cart.

2. Once they've added a taco, they should be able to click on the card to open a drawer from the side that shows them all of the tacos that they have in their cart with picture of the taco and the name of the taco.
