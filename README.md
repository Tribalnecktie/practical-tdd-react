# Practical TDD for React

Practical TDD for React is a workshop focused on teaching a _practical_ approach to TDD. We're going to spend a lot of time looking at tools, techniques, and tradeoffs that I believe will make TDD much more realistic for you to start practicing in your day-to-day work and consequently, make your job much more productive and enjoyable. If you already practice TDD, then I believe this workshop will offer some new perspective for you on how to make your TDD workflow more productive.

Please make sure that you're able to run the app and tests successfully before the workshop. This will allow us to spend as much time as possible on the good stuff. :pizza: Also, I highly recommend working through the [Resources](#Resources) :nerd_face: in this README prior to the workshop. It will make the workshop much more productive for you if you come in with least a base level familiarity with the tools and techniques we're going to be using. I look forward to seeing you there! :fireworks:

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you have the following installed before beginning:

- Node 10.16.x / npm 6.9.x. I highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manager your Node versions.
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) 1.17.x
- [git](https://git-scm.com/): 2.22.x (a different version of git should work fine, but try installing this version if you run into issues).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies: `yarn`.
3. Run the tests: `yarn test`.
4. Run the app: `yarn start`.

## Project Structure

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Please see the [docs](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs) for info on anything related to create-react-app.

## Resources

Cypress is an awesome tool for writing flexible E2E and integration tests. If you don't know what E2E and integration tests are, don't worry. We'll go over them in the workshop. Getting familiar with Cypress would still be a great idea though. You can check out the docs [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#In-a-nutshell)

React Testing Library is a library developed by Kent Dodds. It's focus is on providing tools to make your React component tests act more like a user. General intro [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/intro) and React Testing Library intro [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).
